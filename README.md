# Milestone-Project-3


The inspiration for our application was to revamp a dog foster website for a local animal shelter.

To run the application you will need to run "npm i" and "npm start" in both the client and server folders.

To build this application we used:

    - React
    - Express Node
    - Sass
    - Auth0
    - JavaScript
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - MongoDB
    - NoSQL
    - ODM

Some functionalities we plan to add is a front end for an admin to log in and update photos and text of current dogs available.
