# Milestone-Project-3


The inspiration for our application was to revamp a dog foster website for a local animal shelter.

To run the application you will need to run `npm i` and `npm start` in both the client and server folders.

Make sure the Front-End is running on port 3000 and the Back-End is running on port 3001

To build this application we used:

    - React
    - Express Node
    - Sass
    - Auth0
    - JavaScript
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - MongoDB
    - NoSQL
    - ODM

Some functionalities we plan to add and bugs we are working through:

- A front end for an admin page that has the folliwng features:
    - A React mailbox that allows the admin to send and recieve emails directly through the website.
    - A front-end CRUD that allows the admin to update and delete photos and names for avaible dogs to adopt.
    - A front-end that the admin can access to view all submitted forms such as the contact and foster application forms.
    - Giving proper access to only the admin and not any normal visiters.

- Small styling tweaks:
    - Adding a hamburger button the the mobile nav view.
    - Basic adjustments between desktop and mobile view.
    - Sub navbar buttons for a foster volunetter and donations that link to a PayPal.

- Back-End"
    - Getting the rest of the forms to properly submit to the back-end and then redirecting them to the front end admin page.

- Deployment:
    - Properly getting the front-end and back-end deployed so the animal rescue can start using thier new and improved website.
